                    The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (
as of October 2017) aims at providing a more
efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among
items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or
dynamic (thus the word “flex”).
a W3C Candidate
Recommendation
The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container
the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to
best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all
kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container
expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to
prevent overflow. Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as
opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based
and inline which is horizontally-based). While those work well
for pages, they lack flexibility (no pun intended) to support
large or complex applications (especially when it comes to
orientation changing, resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.).

<br>
<br>
Note: Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of
an application, and small-scale layouts, while the layout
is intended for larger scale layouts.

                    Since flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it
involves a lot of things including its whole set of properties.
Some of them are meant to be set on the container (parent
element, known as “flex container”) whereas the others are
meant to be set on the children (said “flex items”).
If “regular” layout is based on both block and inline flow
directions, the flex layout is based on “flex-flow directions”.
Please have a look at this figure from the specification,
explaining the main idea behind the flex layout.
Items will be laid out following either the main axis (from
main-start to main-end ) or the cross axis (from cross-start to
cross-end ).
<br>
<br>
<br>
• main axis – The main axis of a flex container is the
primary axis along which flex items are laid out. Beware,
it is not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the flexdirection property (see below).
<br>
<br>
<br>
• main-start | main-end – The flex items are placed within
the container starting from main-start and going to mainend
<br>
<br>
<br>
• main size – A flex item’s width or height, whichever is in
the main dimension, is the item’s main size. The flex
item’s main size property is either the ‘width’ or ‘height’
property, whichever is in the main dimension.
<br>
<br>
<br>
• cross axis – The axis perpendicular to the main axis is
called the cross axis. Its direction depends on the main
axis direction.
<br>
<br>
<br>
• cross-start | cross-end – Flex lines are filled with items
and placed into the container starting on the cross-start
side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end
side.
<br>
<br>
<br>
• cross size – The width or height of a flex item, whichever
is in the cross dimension, is the item’s cross size. The
cross size property is whichever of ‘width’ or ‘height’
that is in the cross dimension.

                    Control flow statements allow you to control the order which certain parts of your code are executed. Python provides various control flow statements, including if...else,while, and for loops,
